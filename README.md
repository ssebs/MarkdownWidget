# MarkdownWidget

Show a Markdown file on your Android home screen. 

The goal of this fork is to merge the efforts of https://github.com/Tiim/Android-Markdown-Widget and https://github.com/Irony95/ObsidianAndroidWidget/. 

Personally, I use Markor + Syncthing for my notes, so I just want to have the styling of the forked version, but with the onclick functionality of the original.

## Usage:
- Download the `.apk`
  - https://github.com/ssebs/MarkdownWidget/releases
- Install [you may need to enable developer mode](https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-install-apks-31494/)
- Add the `MarkdownWidget` to your home screen, select a file, and hit save.

## TODO:
- [x] Fix build
- [x] Make clicking the contents open the file in markor
- [x] Improve UI
- [x] Improve UX (don't select folder then file every time, etc)
- [x] Fix bug with files being too large
- [ ] Cleanup
