# MarkdownWidget
> This is a ~~hacked together android widget app created for Obsidian
I am not a professional in android development, therefore the widget might not work for all android versions due to permission issues. If you have any suggestions feel free to message me/ open up an issue!~~ fork of https://github.com/Irony95/ObsidianAndroidWidget/ 

The goal of this fork is to merge the efforts of https://github.com/Tiim/Android-Markdown-Widget and ttps://github.com/Irony95/ObsidianAndroidWidget/. Personally, I use Markor + Syncthing for my notes, so I just want to have the styling of the forked version, but with the onclick functionality of the original.

## TODO:
- [x] Fix build
- [ ] Make clicking the contents open the file in markor
- [ ] Improve UI
- [ ] Improve UX (don't select folder then file every time, etc)

## Reqs:
- Allow open in (Markor, other) app on tap.
- Allow multiple instances of the widget pointing to other files.

## Building:
TBD
